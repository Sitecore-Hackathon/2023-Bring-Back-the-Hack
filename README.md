 Best Enhancement to SXA Headless
 
## Module Name
 SXA Headless - Login Integration/Secured Pages

## Description

Logging in using external identity providers (google, github etc) to access gated content is a common usage pattern users engage with every day.  Among other applications, it is a reliable starting point for gathering user data, tracking their journey through a site,  optimizing for maximum engagement.

This module implements complete implemntation of Authentication and Authorization for Sitecore that is still minimal and ready to be built upon and customized.

### Features
- Integration with external authentication provider - GitHub, out of the box and can be readily expanded with other any providers offered by [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/).

- Control what areas of the website are secured/gated from Site setting area in CMS

   ![Can't access gated content](docs/images/CantAccessGatedPage.png?raw=true)

- Building custom NextJs middleware using Sitecores middlware plugin architecutre to determine whether the user have access to the requested page. [Edge Middleware Reference](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api)

- Implement caching on top of GraphQl to query the secured pages mapping less frequently, and have the majority of the work done on Edge runtime
- Extending SXA toolbox to include Account related components
- Integration with Gravatar - Globaly Recognizable Avatars ([Link](https://en.gravatar.com/)).  And ability to further configured it to match sites look and feel:
